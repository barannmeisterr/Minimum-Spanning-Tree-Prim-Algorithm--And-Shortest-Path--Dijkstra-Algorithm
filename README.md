# Minimum-Spanning-Tree(Prim Algorithm)-And-Shortest-Path-(Dijkstra Algorithm
 This project finds the smallest path with minimum spanning tree value of connection to loads and source which is Minimum Spanning Tree of the undirected graph and  finds the shortest paths from a single source to all load points and the graph is directed graph.
